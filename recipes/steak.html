    <h2>Pan seared steak, finished in the oven, perfect every time!</h2>
    <p>This steak is great when you aren't willing to fire up the grill for a few steaks.</p>
    <p>Perfect for a quick easy meal, minimal setup, minimal cleaning!</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>2 lb sirloin steak</li>
        <li>2 tbs olive oil</li>
        <li>sea salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees.</li>
        <li>Using paper towels, pat steaks dry. (No liquid should be visible pooling on top or underneath).</li>
        <li>Sprinkle sea salt and black pepper to taste onto steaks.  Sprinkle the garlic powder evenly across.  Make sure to get both sides.</li>
        <li>Preheat large skillet to high heat.  To check the pan is hot enough, flick a few drops of water on the pan.  When it sizzles on contact, we're ready.</li>
        <li>Place steaks in the skillet without crowding the pan.  (This may take a few rounds, that is fine).  Cook each side of steaks for 1 minute 30 seconds.  Transfer to baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Once all steaks are done in the skillet, place baking sheet of steaks into the oven. Cook for 6-8 minutes, depending on desired level of doneness.</li>
    </ol>
